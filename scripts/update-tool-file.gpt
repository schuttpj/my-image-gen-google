tools: sys.read, sys.write

Parse cli.py and determine what CLI options are available. Also parse tool.gpt and
determine the difference between the args defined in tool.gpt and the args defined in
cli.py. Do not include the api-key or model in the args list.

Update the tool.gpt file such that the args and their descriptions in cli.py are exactly represented
in the tool.gpt file.
